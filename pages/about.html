        <h3>About Me:</h3><br>
        <p>Hello! My name is Luthando Nkosi.
            You probably can tell from my portfolio that I love taking pictures. Haha!
          While I am not a proffessional photographer,I love to express my art in many creative ways. Makeup 
          being one of the many art forms. I was born a creator! From drawing and painting
          ,to learning how to do my own makeup, and then learning how to design through tech and sewing my own clothes , I'd
          say life hasn't been all too boring, but a BLAST!!
<br><br>
          I started taking an interest in makeup from when I was a young girl dancing ballet. We had to learn to do our own 
          and each others makeup for performances. My passion started growing again during the Covid-19 pandemic and I started
          getting comfortable applying more than just lip-gloss and mascara. Since then I've been the family/friend
          makeup artist and I want to do more than just help my girlies close to me but also be of any help to all the girlies!
<br><br>
          Let me re-introduce myself! <br>
          Hi! My name is Luthando Nkosi your go to makeup artist! <br>
          Nice to meet you!
